# Neural_networks

This project aims at predicting the type of blood cell. Matlab code is used in this project.

1.Here we use MATLAB as our environment. 

2. Kaggle website gives us the dataset that is used in this project.

3. Here we classify the type of blood cell using Convolutional Neural Network.

4. The model used in this project is built from scratch.

5. For better accuracy, vary the batch size, number of epochs etc.

6. CNN has a bit ofimage processing technique used. For example the ReLU activation layer.

7. Images are augmented i.e rotated, expanded, squeezed in size. This helps in accuracy.

8. The output is classified into the class 1 and class 2 depending upon th type of blood cell.
